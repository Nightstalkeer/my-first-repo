                I am capable of doing sophisticated game development but IUT the resistance is the main culprit to do my
                tasks. I hate my academic life. However if you want to hire me for game development just ping me and I
                will be there. Best wishes.

                I already learned the basic HTML and CSS. I can build any simple website. I can even teach my Rubban how
                to make simple website. My goal is to build 3 websites and learn advanced topics.

                    They didn't offer me a job. But I made myself as a remove web developer. I made their website
                    and
                    showed
                    it to them. They liked it, and uploaded the content. It was fun working at Programming Hero.
